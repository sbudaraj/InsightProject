# InsightProject

Project Idea:

Containerized continuous delivery SW workflow that relies using Docker, GitHub, Jenkins and Terraform and Kubernetes

What is the problem:

Many of us have great ideas that do not translate to a product because we do not have time, skills or resources to build the solution. On the other hand there are many ambitious high school and college students with strong technical skills that are looking for real world experience applying their skills.  

Poposed Solution at high level:

My propoasl will have a  way to take project definition (business idea) and translate it into  feature list of chunk sized development tasks. These will then be picked by a small group of developers (vetted* HS/college students) that will work off of a predefined SW architecture and predefined docker containers.  We will build a weekly deployment cadence based on SCM principles. GitHub feature code check ins will trigger Jenkins pipeline. Finalized main line will be deployed on a AB model using Kubernetes.

First project definition/use case will be a Flask/Python/mySQL stack followed. Strech goal will be to do this for a XCode and possible Android SW workflows too. 

Technologies that will be used:

GitHub, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform and Kubernetes
